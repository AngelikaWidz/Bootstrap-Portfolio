# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Continuing with learning CSS Flexbox and Flexgrid - this week I started adding Bootstrap 5 into the mix, still familiarising myself with the functions/concepts picking up new skills along the way.

The point of this project is to have a base portfolio for when I am ready to start applying to jobs - so that I don't spend a million hours deciding on a design later on, but rather I can just be efficient and just refine the portfolio, ready to hit the ground running.
